/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:
 * 
 * For a real VPN application, you would need to:
 * 
 * 1. Use a native module to interface with VPN protocols:
 *    - For OpenVPN: react-native-openvpn
 *    - For WireGuard: react-native-wireguard
 * 
 * 2. Set up VPN profiles with your server configurations
 * 
 * 3. Handle authentication with your VPN backend
 * 
 * 4. Implement system-level integration:
 *    - VPN permission requests
 *    - Background service for maintaining connections
 *    - System notifications for connection status
 * 
 * 5. Handle secure storage of credentials and certificates
 * 
 * 6. Implement proper error handling for various failure modes:
 *    - Authentication failures
 *    - Network unavailable
 *    - Server unreachable
 *    - Permission denied
 * 
 * Refer to VPN protocol documentation and React Native
 * native module guides for specific implementation details.
